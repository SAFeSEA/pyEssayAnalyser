Write a report explaining the main accessibility challenges for disabled learners that you work with or support in your own work context(s).
Use examples from your own experience, supported by the research and practice literature.
If you’re not a practitioner, write from the perspective of a person in a relevant context.
Critically evaluate the influence of the context (e.g. country, institution, educational sector, perceived role of online learning within education) on:
• the identified challenges particular to your own context
• the influence of legislation and local policies
• the roles and responsibilities of key individuals
• the role of assistive technologies in addressing these challenges.
Remember to give a word count at the end of your assignment. You will need to be selective in what you write about and how you write about it, because you will be writing about subjects on which you are the expert (yourself and your working or other chosen context). The report should be practice-based and critical, not a theoretical essay, but you are expected to reference evidence from the literature that you have come across thus far. Some students who have taken H810 in the
past have made good use of published local guidelines and policies to explain the context. The sort of report that you are being asked to write would and should be read by other people who share the same working context (e.g. senior management or co-workers); however, they are busy people with many other commitments, so be concise, formal and focused.
