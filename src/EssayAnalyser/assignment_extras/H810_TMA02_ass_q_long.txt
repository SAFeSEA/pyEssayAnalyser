In Week 10 you are asked to create a self-contained learning resource that could be used by other students. Details of this activity and the location of other students’ resources are in the module material for Week 10.
Critically evaluate your own learning resource in the following ways:
Briefly describe the resource and its accessibility features. Compare these to one learning resource created by another student in your tutor group.
1. Evaluate the accessibility of your resource, identifying its strengths and weaknesses. Propose, with justification, ways in which its accessibility could be improved. (This could include suggesting alternatives.)
2. Reflect on the processes of creating and evaluating accessible resources. Use the research and practice literature to explain and understand your experiences of these processes.
3. Again, remember to give a word count at the end of your assignment.
