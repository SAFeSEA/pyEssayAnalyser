In Block 3, you are asked to identify nine issues (three from each chapter) from Chapters 11, 12 and 13 in E-Learning and Disability in Higher Education:
Accessibility Research and Practice (Seale, 2006).
Choose three of the nine accessibility issues that you identified. Some examples of issues that we think are interesting are given in the relevant activities, but you can choose your own. You can choose one from each chapter or they can be from the same chapter, but they must be three distinct issues.
Then, using your own experience, supported by the research and practice literature, explore these issues in detail:
1. Discuss and evaluate the significance or relevance of each identified issue to the development and provision of accessible online learning within your own working or chosen context(s).
2. Analyse the extent to which the identified issues complement or contradict one another and the influence that this might have on the development and provision of accessible online learning in your own context(s).
3. Reflect on the impact (actual or potential) of the identified issues on your own professional practice.

We assume that most students will choose the same context that they described in TMA01. However, if this is problematic, you might choose some other context. This is discussed in the Module Guide in the section ‘If you are not a practitioner’.
It is important that you relate your answer to the issues raised in Jane Seale’s book and the other resources that you have used. 
Once again, remember to give a word count at the end of your EMA.
